Before using, please make sure you add content of credits.txt before using it.

How to use:
1. Make sure this archive has been extracted in graphics/battlebacks so you have the folder graphics/battlebacks/vs_bar in your project.
2. Make sure the vs bar is called this way: bar_dpp_<battlerSpriteName>
3. Make sure the mugshot is called this way: mugshot_<battlerSpriteName>
4. Set the switch 31 to 3 and start a battle, it will show the DPP gym leader transition

For example a trainer with the battlerSpriteName set to 027 (Gary the scout) will require bar_dpp_027 and mugshot_027 in graphics/battlebacks/vs_bar.

How to add new mugshots:
The file on the following message: https://discord.com/channels/143824995867557888/360856242111119360/1111247433616330813 contains mugshot in the right dimensions.
What you need to do is picking one of the mugshot from that archive, name it mugshot_<battlerSpriteName> and move it to graphics/battlebacks/vs_bar.

Note: it's better if you use your own resources ;)
