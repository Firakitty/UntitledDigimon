All stats should have a total higher than 0 (Not a single stat should be 0)
Evolutions have equal or higher total in each stat unless it says that stat is the lowest
Form changes have the same stat total and just different stat distribution unless stated otherwise
Max allowed in a single stat is 255 so I recommend not to use that number and stay away from it if possible
Sort it by HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, and Special Defense
